/**
 * Canonical Customer Ledger Service (BUG-ERP-008 / PHASE 12 / PHASE 16 / PHASE 20)
 *
 * Single source of truth for how a customer's receivable balance is represented.
 *
 * The real PostgreSQL `customers` table has NO `balance` / `current_balance`
 * column. Historically several writers did
 *     `UPDATE customers SET balance = COALESCE(balance,0) + $1`
 * which either threw ("column does not exist") or silently diverged from the
 * ledger. Receivable is therefore *derived* from `customer_transactions`, which
 * is the append-only ledger, and `customers.total_orders` / `total_spent` /
 * `last_order_date` remain display aggregates only.
 *
 * Canonical `customer_transactions.type` values:
 *   - 'invoice'      -> DEBIT  (increases what the customer owes)
 *   - 'payment'      -> CREDIT (reduces what the customer owes)
 *   - 'adjustment'   -> signed manual correction (amount carries the sign)
 *   - 'reversal'     -> CREDIT (undoes a previously posted debit)
 *
 * Legacy synonyms ('debit'/'credit') are still tolerated when *reading* so that
 * rows written by older code keep reconciling, but nothing new writes them.
